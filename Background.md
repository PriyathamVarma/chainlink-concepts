# Basic Concepts

Ethereum is the blockchain/database

EVM is a computing machine that can execute contracts

Solidity is the programming language for writing smart contracts

## Oracle problem and chainlink

Smart contracts are unable to connect with external systems, data feeds, APIs, existing payments, or any other off-chain data

### Blockchain oracle

Any device that interacts with the off-chain world to provide external data or computation to smart contracts

Chainlink contains

- Data Feeds: data providers
- Data streams: faster data feeds
- VRF(verifiable random numbers): Random numbers
- Automation: 
- Proof of reserve: 
- CCIP: Connecting to different blockchains
- Functions: Execute any code, for instance, you can get js callbacks
